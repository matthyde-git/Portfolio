# Auctions App

This folder contains all of the code for an application that allows for live auctions, it involves:
- MVC architecture to split the system into separate layers to increase maintainability and scalability
- React JS to produce fast and responsive front-end views
- Express JS to produce the controller and models that communicate user actions to the application database (can be found in the app folder)
- Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI to create usable and stylish user interface components
- The Redux Toolkit to manage the states of the frontend components
- The React Router DOM for fast, client-side page routing

Note: Whilst they are required for the app to work, I have removed my Auth0 domain and clientid from the main.JSX for privacy reasons
